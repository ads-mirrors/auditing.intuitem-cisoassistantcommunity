This script prepares the file to be parsed by the converter:

- Copy the downloaded excel sheet from CIS next to this script (for instance CIS_Controls_Version_8.xlsx)
- Run the preparation script by passing the filename as 1st argument and your name/entity as a second one for the packager (e.g. `./convert_cis.sh ./cis_v8.xlsx intuitem`)
- Run the converter on the prepared excel sheet
- Use the resulting yaml in CISO Assistant
