1.2.2. The relevant entities shall require all personnel and third parties to apply network and information system security
in accordance with the established network and information security policy, topic-specific policies and procedures of the
relevant entities.
GUIDANCE
• 
Make personnel aware of the security roles in the entity and when each role should be contacted.
• 
Make personnel aware of their network and information system security obligations, according to their
role. For the disciplinary process, see point 10.4 in the Annex to the regulation.
• 
Make relevant interested external parties aware of their network and information system security
obligations.
o 
For contractual requirements of direct suppliers and service providers, see point 5.1.4 in the
Annex to the regulation.
o 
Consider third parties, which means external entities or organisations not directly involved in the
operations of the entity in scope but that may still affect its network and information security. For
examples of relevant interested external parties, consider the guidance in section 1.1.
• 
The requirement that all personnel and third parties apply network and information system security should
be communicated in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the intended reader.
o 
The network and information security policy, topic-specific policies and procedures of the relevant
entities do not necessarily need to be communicated in their entirety.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Awareness/dissemination material for personnel, explaining security roles and when/how they should be
contacted.
•

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
1.2.4. Depending on the size of the relevant entities, network and information system security shall be covered by
dedicated roles or duties carried out in addition to existing roles.
GUIDANCE
• 
It is often practical to have dedicated information security roles (e.g. a chief information security officer or
security analysts) who focus solely on protecting the entity’s data and systems.
• 
In entities with limited resources, information security responsibilities may be distributed among existing
roles. For instance, information technology (IT) staff might take on security duties alongside their regular
tasks. However, the persons assigned should have relevant experience and training to perform the roles
and to exercise their responsibilities.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Verify the presence of dedicated security roles in larger entities.
• 
Check if security responsibilities are assigned to existing roles in smaller entities.
1.2.5. Conflicting duties and conflicting areas of responsibility shall be segregated, where applicable.
GUIDANCE
• 
Consider segregating conflicting duties and areas of responsibility to reduce opportunities for unauthorized
or unintentional modification or misuse of the entity’s asset. As a minimum, consider that the reviewer
(auditor) must be different from the personnel or the line of authority of the area under review.
• 
The results of the risk assessment or the business impact analysis (BIA) could be used to identify potential
conflicting duties and areas of responsibility.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Up-to-date documentation of the structure of security role assignments and responsibilities.
1.2.6. Roles, responsibilities and authorities shall be reviewed and, where appropriate, updated by management bodies
at planned intervals and when significant incidents or significant changes to operations or risks occur.
GUIDANCE
• 
Regularly review and revise the structure of security roles and responsibilities, based on (indicative, non-
exhaustive list):
o 
significant incidents, if any;
o 
changes to the environment of operation, including changes to the network and information
systems;
o 
organisational changes.
• 
Where appropriate, updates should be approved by management bodies.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Up-to-date documentation of the structure of security role assignments and responsibilities, including
version history.
• 
Documentation of the review process, taking into account changes and past incidents.

2. RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY
2.1 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 
2.1.1. For the purpose of Article 21(2), point (a) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the relevant entities shall establish and
maintain an appropriate risk management framework to identify and address the risks posed to the security of network
and information systems. The relevant entities shall perform and document risk assessments and, based on the results,
establish, implement and monitor a risk treatment plan. Risk assessment results and residual risks (12) shall be accepted
by management bodies or, where applicable, by persons who are accountable and have the authority to manage risks,
provided that the relevant entities ensure adequate reporting to the management bodies.
GUIDANCE
• 
The entity can use its current risk management framework or adopt a new one (13). A risk management
framework is the structured approach used by an entity to identify, assess, manage and mitigate its
cybersecurity risks.
• 
Create a risk treatment plan that associates the identified risks with assets and the measures mitigating
the associated risks and takes into account, at least, elements (g) to (h) in point 2.1.2 of the Annex to the
regulation. The plan should at least include:
o 
a description of the identified risk and how it can negatively affect security objectives;
o 
a risk treatment option (for example risk avoidance, risk mitigation, risk transfer or sharing or risk
acceptance);
o 
the assets associated with the risk;
o 
the measures which mitigate the risk;
o 
a procedure for assessing the effectiveness of implementation of the measure(s);
o 
implementation timelines; and
o 
responsible roles.
• 
Consider residual risks from third parties, for example, data breaches, unaddressed vulnerabilities,
regulatory non-compliance from the from the third-party side and over-reliance on a single third party.
• 
Ensure residual risks are accepted by management bodies or, where applicable, persons who are
accountable and have the authority to manage risks, in line with the acceptable residual risk levels of the
entity.
• 
Make sure that management bodies or, where applicable, persons who are accountable and have the
authority to manage risks approve the risk-assessment results and risk-treatment plan.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Documented risk management framework.
• 
Documented results from previous risk assessments.
• 
Documented risk treatment plan.

• 
Record of approval of risk assessment results by management bodies or by persons who are accountable
and have the authority to manage risks.
• 
Record of approval of residual risks by management bodies or, where applicable, by persons who are
accountable and have the authority to manage risks.
2.1.2. For the purpose of point 2.1.1, the relevant entities shall establish procedures for identification, analysis,
assessment and treatment of risks (‘cybersecurity risk management process’). The cybersecurity risk management
process shall be an integral part of the relevant entities’ overall risk management process, where applicable. As part of
the cybersecurity risk management process, the relevant entities shall:
(a) follow a risk management methodology;
(b) establish the risk tolerance level in accordance with the risk appetite of the relevant entities;
(c) establish and maintain relevant risk criteria;
(d) in line with an all-hazards approach, identify and document the risks posed to the security of network and information
systems, in particular in relation to third parties and risks that could lead to disruptions in the availability, integrity,
authenticity and confidentiality of the network and information systems, including the identification of single point of
failures;
(e) analyse the risks posed to the security of network and information systems, including threat, likelihood, impact and
risk level, taking into account cyber threat intelligence and vulnerabilities;
(f) evaluate the identified risks based on the risk criteria;
(g) identify and prioritise appropriate risk treatment options and measures;
(h) continuously monitor the implementation of the risk treatment measures;
(i) identify who is responsible for implementing the risk treatment measures and when they should be implemented;
(j) document the chosen risk treatment measures in a risk treatment plan and the reasons justifying the acceptance of
residual risks in a comprehensible manner.
GUIDANCE
• 
Select a risk management methodology (14).
• 
Establish the entity's risk appetite, that is the amount of risk that the entity is strategically willing to accept
to achieve its objectives. Criteria may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
business strategic objectives;
o 
stakeholder expectations;
o 
regulatory requirements; and
o 
organizational culture.
• 
Define the risk tolerance level, which refers to the level of risk that an entity is willing to accept in pursuit
of its long-term objectives. Examples may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
acceptable downtime for systems for which criticality is high (e.g. up to two hours of downtime
per month);
o 
tolerance for data loss (e.g. loss of data with low criticality within a 24-hour window);
o 
maximum financial loss that can be absorbed without jeopardizing operations (e.g. up to EUR
100,000 in recovery costs);
(14) There are many risk-management standards, frameworks and methodologies. A non-exhaustive list of them can be found in the ENISA publication 
Compendium of risk-managements frameworks with potential interoperability, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/compendium-of-risk-
management-frameworks.
22

--- PAGE 24 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
o 
willingness to invest a certain percentage of revenue in measures (e.g. 5% of annual revenue);
o 
adherence to regulatory obligations with specific penalties or fines influencing risk acceptance;
o 
acceptable level of customer dissatisfaction or negative media exposure from a data breach (e.g.
tolerating one major incident every few years);
o 
acceptance of certain vulnerabilities based on risk mitigation measures in place (e.g. outdated
software provided that it is monitored and patched regularly);
o 
time frame for responding to and recovering from incidents (e.g. a maximum of 48 hours for
containment); and
o 
acceptance of minor incidents as part of normal operations while prioritizing major threats.
• 
Define risk acceptance criteria, which may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list) (15):
o 
accepting risks categorized as low severity, such as minor data leaks that don't expose sensitive
information;
o 
accepting risks assessed as having a low likelihood of occurrence (e.g. certain rare types of
cyberattacks);
o 
accepting risks if the cost of mitigation exceeds the potential impact (e.g. not upgrading legacy
systems if the upgrade cost is significantly higher than potential losses);
o 
accepting specific compliance risks if there is a plan in place to address them within a defined
timeframe (e.g. temporarily accepting minor non-compliance with a commitment to remediate
within six months);
o 
allowing certain risks in low-criticality systems or departments that do not affect core business
operations (e.g. accepting a risk in a test environment);
o 
accepting certain vulnerabilities for a defined period while planning for remediation (e.g.
accepting the risk of outdated software for three months until a full upgrade can be completed);
o 
accepting risks where the expected incident impact falls below a predetermined financial
threshold (e.g. losses under EUR 50,000 accepted without further action);
o 
accepting risks after informing stakeholders and receiving their agreement, particularly if they
understand the trade-offs involved; and
o 
accepting residual risks where existing measures reduce the likelihood or impact to an acceptable
level (e.g. using encryption for sensitive data but accepting risks of loss due to user error).
• 
Define risk criteria, that is, how the entity evaluates the significance of the risks that it identifies and makes
decisions concerning risks. Risk criteria may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
alignment with risk appetite: accepting risks that align with the organization's overall risk appetite,
such as delays in internal reporting processes that do not impact customer service or compliance;
o 
regulatory and legal exposure: prioritizing risks based on potential legal or regulatory
consequences, such as treating violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
involving customer data as high-risk due to potential fines and reputational damage;
o 
reputational impact: escalating risks that could significantly harm the organization's public image,
such as incidents likely to attract media attention;
o 
risk velocity: giving higher priority to risks with high velocity, such as zero-day exploits that can
be weaponised before patches are available;
(15) More information on risk criteria can be found in ISO/IEC 27005:2022, paragraph 6.4. It is important to understand that risk appetite, defined as the 
amount of risk an entity is willing to pursue or accept, can vary considerably from entity to entity. For instance, factors affecting an entity’s risk 
appetite include size, complexity and sector.
23

--- PAGE 25 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
o 
recovery complexity: treating risks as critical if they involve complex or time-consuming recovery,
such as cyber-attacks on legacy systems with limited vendor support;
o 
emerging technology risks: Considering risks involving emerging technologies as higher priority,
such as AI systems producing unexplainable or non-compliant decisions due to lack of
transparency;
o 
stakeholder sensitivity: re-evaluating risks that concern key stakeholders, such as risks flagged
by the board, regulators or major customers, even if the assessed technical risk is low.
• 
Criteria for performing cybersecurity risk assessments refer to consequences, likelihood or level of risk.
These may refer to (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
the importance of assets;
o 
the severity of threats;
o 
the vulnerability of network and information systems (16);
o 
impact analysis;
o 
existing measures; and
o 
stakeholders concerns or requirements.
• 
Make a list of the main risks for the security of network and information systems, taking into account the
main threats to the assets in scope.
• 
Make sure that each risk is associated with at least one:
o 
of the risk treatment options or a combination of them, in line with the results of the risk
assessment and in accordance with the entity’s policy on the security of network and information
systems (recital 11 of the regulation); and
o 
specific risk treatment measure.
• 
Develop risk-treatment plans to address the elements in points (i) and (j) in point 2.1.2 of the Annex to the
regulation.
• 
Assign responsibilities to appropriate individuals or teams for executing these risk treatment plans.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Documented cybersecurity risk-management process that takes into account elements referred to in
point 2.1.2 of the Annex to the regulation.
• 
Documented risk-management methodology and/or tools that take into account at least elements (a) to (f)
in point 2.1.2 of the Annex to the regulation.
• 
List of the main risks described at a high level, including underlying threat(s) and unaddressed
vulnerabilities and their potential impact on the security of networks and services.
• 
Make sure that the entity follows an all-hazards approach (check that the risk-assessment approach
addresses a wide range of potential threats and risks, not just the cyber ones, but natural or man-made,
accidental or intentional threats and risks).
• 
Evidence that residual risks resulting from dependencies on third parties are listed and mitigated.
(16)  Vulnerabilities of network and information systems may also arise from human, organizational, and procedural weaknesses.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
2.1.3. When identifying and prioritising appropriate risk treatment options and measures, the relevant entities shall take
into account the risk assessment results, the results of the procedure to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk-
management measures, the cost of implementation in relation to the expected benefit, the asset classification referred
to in point 12.1 and the business impact analysis referred to in point 4.1.3.
GUIDANCE
• 
Make sure that personnel take into account the elements referred to in point 2.1.3 of the Annex to the
regulation.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Guidance for personnel on assessing risks that takes into account the elements referred to in point 2.1.3
of the Annex to the regulation.
2.1.4. The relevant entities shall review and, where appropriate, update the risk assessment results and the risk
treatment plan at planned intervals and at least annually and when significant changes to operations or risks or
significant incidents occur.
GUIDANCE
• 
Review risk assessment results and risk treatment at least annually taking into account:
o 
results of audits and previous reviews,
o 
status of implementation of the measures described in the risk treatment plan (see the policy on
the assessment of the effectiveness of measures in line with the Annex to Regulation,
point 7.1.1);
o 
changes to the information systems;
o 
changes to the environment of operation;
o 
post-incident review findings (section 3.6); and
o 
trends and changes related to threats and vulnerabilities, as they may affect risks.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Documentation of the review process.
• 
Review comments or change logs for the risk assessment and risk treatment plan.
TIPS
GUIDANCE
• 
Ensure that key personnel use the risk management methodology and tools.
• 
Overall, the entity has four risk treatment options associated with each risk. Each option should be
accompanied by specific risk treatment measures (indicative, non-exhaustive list of examples):
o 
Risk avoidance: as a measure to treat this risk, the entity might choose to eliminate activities or
conditions that expose the entity to this risk, for example, discontinuing the use of a vulnerable
software application.
o 
Risk mitigation: as a measure to treat this risk, the entity might choose to implement measures
to reduce the likelihood or impact of such a risk. This can include installing firewalls, using
encryption and conducting regular security training for employees.
25

--- PAGE 27 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
o 
Risk transfer or sharing: as a measure to treat this risk, the entity might choose to shift parts of
the risk impact to another party, typically through insurance or outsourcing certain functions to
third-party providers. However, it is important to note that such arrangements do not eliminate
the entity’s overall accountability or legal obligations regarding the risk. For instance, purchasing
cyber insurance may cover potential data breach costs, but the entity remains responsible for
implementing appropriate security measures and complying with data protection regulations.
o 
Risk acceptance: as a measure to treat this risk, the entity might choose to acknowledge the risk
and decide to accept it without taking any specific action, often because the cost of mitigation is
higher than the potential impact. This approach is usually accompanied by a contingency plan to
manage the risk if it materialises. The approach should be clearly documented, supported by a
realistic estimation of potential costs and including financial provisions to address the impact
should the risk materialise.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
3.2.3. Based on the procedures referred to in point 3.2.1., the relevant entities shall maintain, document and review
logs. The relevant entities shall establish a list of assets to be subject to logging based on the results of the risk
assessment carried out pursuant to point 2.1. Where appropriate, logs shall include:
(a) relevant outbound and inbound network traffic;
(b) creation, modification or deletion of users of the relevant entities’ network and information systems and extension of
the permissions;
(c) access to systems and applications;
(d) authentication-related events;
(e) all privileged access to systems and applications and activities performed by administrative accounts;
(f) access or changes to critical configuration and backup files;
(g) event logs and logs from security tools, such as antivirus, intrusion detection systems or firewalls;

(l) environmental events.
GUIDANCE
• 
With regard to critical configuration, consider the settings and parameters that are vital for the proper
functioning, security and performance of the entity’s network and information system. These configurations
are vital because any changes or misconfigurations might have a significant impact, including system
outages, security vulnerabilities or reduced performance of the entity’s network and information system.
• 
Consult the risk assessment results to determine which network traffic needs to be logged. For example,
if certain assets are identified as high risk (e.g. due to being potentially vulnerable or crucial to the business
operation) their inbound and outbound traffic should be logged for monitoring and analysis.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Samples of log files containing the elements referred to in point 3.2.3 of the Annex to the regulation.
• 
Samples of log files containing current and historical domain name system (DNS) and dynamic host
configuration protocol (DHCP) logs.
3.2.4. The logs shall be regularly reviewed for any unusual or unwanted trends. Where appropriate, the relevant entities
shall lay down appropriate values for alarm thresholds. If the laid down values for alarm threshold are exceeded, an
alarm shall be triggered, where appropriate, automatically. The relevant entities shall ensure that, in case of an alarm,
a qualified and appropriate response is initiated in a timely manner.
GUIDANCE
• 
Consider the use of anomaly detection or adaptive alarm thresholds to complement traditional static rules.
• 
Make sure that procedures are designed to detect network-based attacks based on anomalous inbound
and outbound ingress or egress traffic patterns and/or denial of service (DoS) attacks, in a timely manner.
37

--- PAGE 39 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
• 
Make sure that alarm thresholds, where appropriate, have been set in alignment with the results of the
risk assessment carried out pursuant to point 2.1, covering at least the situations in point 3.2.3 of the
Annex to the regulation. An indicative, non-exhaustive list of examples with thresholds (22) follows:
o 
relevant outbound and inbound network traffic: traffic volume spikes exceeding 50% of normal
traffic in a 10-minute period on a specific port;
o 
access to systems and applications: three or more account lockouts within 15 minutes;
o 
privileged access: two or more instances of privilege escalation (e.g. normal user to admin) within 24 hours (23);
o 
antivirus: malware is detected on multiple endpoints within a short timeframe;
o 
use of system resources: installations of unauthorised software within a short timeframe.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Regular reports that summarize log data and highlight any anomalies detected.
• 
Alarm thresholds set.
• 
Records from past alarm triggers when thresholds were exceeded.
• 
Existing workflows that trigger event reporting (section 3.3).
3.2.5. The relevant entities shall maintain and back up logs for a predefined period and shall protect them from
unauthorised access or changes.
GUIDANCE
• 
Make sure that the log retention period is defined in accordance with business needs, the risk assessment
results and legal requirements/obligations.
• 
The backup logs’ maintenance period shouldn’t be shorter than the logs’ review period, referred to in
point 3.2.4 of the Annex to the regulation.
• 
The retention period should be in line with what is referred to in point 4.2.2 (f) of the Annex to the
regulation.
• 
Delete data when the retention period ends.
• 
Consider mechanisms to protect logs from unauthorised access or changes (indicative, non-exhaustive
list):
o 
encryption,
o 
access control,
o 
hashing (section 9.2) and
o 
logging of all access and changes to log files.
• 
The access control should be in line with what is referred to in point 4.2.2 (d) of the Annex to the regulation.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
A retention period is set.
(22) The thresholds are subject to the operational environment. There are several assumptions about the environment that would need to be true for 
these controls/thresholds to be relevant. For certain entities, we expect that these entities will be under constant attack by bad actors and, 
accordingly, should be permitted to leverage continuous, automated and immediate responses. 
(23)  Privileged access alarms shall distinguish between (a) administrative privilege assignment events (e.g. creation or promotion of accounts to 
privileged status) and (b) the use of existing privileged accounts by authorized personnel. The system shall generate an immediate alert upon 
detection of unauthorized or unexpected privilege assignments and a behavioural threshold alert (e.g. ≥2 privilege elevations within 24 hours) for 
monitoring legitimate administrative access patterns.

• 
The retention period is in line with what is referred to in point 4.2.2 (f) of the Annex to the regulation and
is shorter than the logs’ review period, referred to in point 3.2.4 of the Annex to the regulation.
• 
Log management is in place.
• 
Logs do not contain data about which retention periods have expired.
• 
Access control mechanisms are in place.
• 
Access control is in line with what is referred to in point 4.2.2 (d) of the Annex to the regulation.
3.2.6. To the extent feasible, the relevant entities shall ensure that all systems have synchronised time sources to be
able to correlate logs between systems for event assessment. The relevant entities shall establish and keep a list of all
assets that are being logged and ensure that monitoring and logging systems are redundant. The availability of the
monitoring and logging systems shall be monitored independent of the systems they are monitoring.
GUIDANCE
• 
Consider the following for time synchronisation:
o 
Utilize Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers or Precision Time Protocol (PTP) for accurate and
reliable time synchronization (24).
o 
Use authenticated NTP to prevent malicious entities from tampering with your time
synchronization.
o 
Configure a central time server within the entity (25). This server should synchronize with a
reliable external time source and then distribute the time to all other systems within the network.
o 
Use multiple time sources to avoid a single point of failure.
o 
Plan how time synchronization is handled across on-premises systems (for example servers in a
company's own data centre), cloud services, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms -
especially if the organization uses a hybrid environment (a mix of on-premises and cloud-based
systems).
• 
Assets being logged should be marked as such in the asset inventory, in line with what is referred to in
point 12.4 of the Annex to the regulation.
• 
Implement measures to protect log data against loss, including but not limited to redundant storage across
multiple locations (e.g. cloud, secondary servers), retention of processed log events in structured systems
and preservation of derived security insights (e.g. alerts, metrics) in line with what is referred to in point 4.2
of the Annex to the regulation. These complementary approaches ensure both data integrity and
operational continuity in security monitoring and incident response.
• 
Deploy separate tools to monitor the capacity and availability of the entity’s primary monitoring and logging
systems.

point 3.1.2 (a) of the Annex to the regulation.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Defined criteria in place.
• 
A categorisation system referred to in point 3.1.2 (a) of the Annex to the regulation.
3.4.2. For the purpose of point 3.4.1, the relevant entities shall act in the following manner:
(a) carry out the assessment based on predefined criteria laid down in advance and on a triage to determine prioritisation
of incident containment and eradication;
(b) assess the existence of recurring incidents as referred to in Article 4 of this Regulation on a quarterly basis;
(c) review the appropriate logs for the purposes of event assessment and classification;
(d) put in place a process for log correlation and analysis and
(e) reassess and reclassify events in case of new information becoming available or after analysis of previously available
information.
GUIDANCE
• 
In the procedures defined in points 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 of the Annex to the regulation, include activities for
assessing suspicious events to determine their nature and severity. These activities should include steps
such as:
o 
gathering relevant information and evidence related to the event.
o 
analysing the potential impact on the entity’s systems, data and operations.
o 
determining the severity of the incident based on predefined criteria.
• 
Implement playbooks (30) or runbooks to guide initial assessment actions for common types of incidents,
for example ransomware, phishing, data or device loss, or fire.
• 
Classify events based on their nature, severity and potential impact. Common classifications may include:
o 
low, medium, high or critical severity;
o 
incident types (e.g. malicious software infection or unauthorized access);
o 
regulatory or compliance implications.
• 
Prioritise the event according to specific criteria, as defined in the categorisation system included in the
incident handling policy referred to in point 3.1.2 of the Annex to the regulation.
• 
By performing root cause analysis (31), determine recurring instances (32) of an incident.
(30) An example of good practice for such playbooks is the OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) Security Playbooks 
Version Specification, v2.0, https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/security-playbooks-v2.0.html.

• 
Determine the order of recovery based on criteria, including (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
the asset classification level;
o 
the importance of the service for the entity;
o 
dependencies (services or assets that are essential for others are restored first);
o 
recovery objectives (Annex to the regulation, point 4.1.3);
o 
resource availability; and
o 
regulatory requirements.
• 
Conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications and

4.1.3. The relevant entities shall carry out a business impact analysis to assess the potential impact of severe disruptions
to their business operations and shall, based on the results of the business impact analysis, establish continuity
requirements for the network and information systems.
GUIDANCE
• 
Based on the results of the BIA (36) and risk assessment, the entity should establish appropriate recovery
objectives, referred to in point 4.1.2 (f) of the Annex to the regulation (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
Recovery time objectives (RTOs) to determine the maximum amount of time allowed for the
recovery of business resources and functions (e.g. information and communications technology
(ICT) systems and processes, respectively) after a disaster occurs, for example maximum
downtime of the entity’s website, enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or email system.
o 
Recovery point objective (RPO) to determine how much data it is acceptable for specific ICT
activities or applications to lose. Typically, they are measured in maximum time needed to
recover data without causing unacceptable, according to the risk assessment, damage to the
entity’s activities, for example maximum recovery time for an e-commerce website, an ERP
system or an email server.
o 
Service delivery objective (SDO) to determine the minimum level of performance that needs to
be reached by business functions during the alternate processing mode. An indicative and non-
exhaustive list of examples includes:
 
the percentage of inbound calls to be answered by a call centre within a specific
timeframe;
 
the level of availability of ordering and payment systems of an e-commerce website
within a specific timeframe;
 
the restoration time for accessing essential shared folders via a cloud file access
system; and
 
the timeframe within which the full functionality of the remote work infrastructure is
restored.
o 
Maximum acceptable outage (MAO) or maximum tolerable period of disruption (MTPD) to
determine the time it would take for the potential impacts of not providing a product/service or
performing an activity to become unacceptable or significant, in accordance with the risk
assessment. Typically they are longer than RTOs. MAOs focus on service availability while RPOs
focus on data loss. An indicative and non-exhaustive list of examples:
 
the period of time beyond which the customer service would be severely impacted and
reputation risk increases quickly;
 
the longest period of time that extended outage of an e-commerce website might result
to major loss of sales and customer trust;
 
the longest period of time that shared access to project files may halt collaboration or
decision-making in case that data is stored in cloud; and
 
the maximum acceptable outage for remote work infrastructure beyond which business
functions are significantly impaired and productivity losses begin to escalate.

Encryption keys should be stored separately from the backup data to prevent unauthorized access and
ensure recoverability.
• 
Before systems or configurations are restored, a ‘patient zero (37)’ may need to be identified so that the
restoration does not restore any vulnerabilities or infections that have sometimes been cleaned up.
(37) This term is usually used to identify the first system affected by an attack.

o 
on two different types of storage media (e.g. hard drives, cloud storage),
o 
with one copy stored offsite.
• 
Ensure the integrity of backups, that is, prevent any modification or deletion, such as ransomware
encryption or tampering, within a defined retention period. Ways to ensure this include (indicative, non-
exhaustive list):
o 
malware and ransomware scanning of backups before backups are stored;
o 
use of immutable backups;
o 
offline storage of backups.
• 
Integrate business continuity and disaster recovery plans with incident response (Annex to the regulation,
point 3.5) and crisis management processes (Annex to the regulation, point 4.3).
• 
When available cloud services:
o 
backups will be replicated across multiple availability zones or stored in an alternate region to
ensure resilience against zone-level failures;
o 
will be configured with cross-zone replication to minimise downtime;
o 
all backup data will be encrypted at rest using cloud-native key management systems and
encrypted during transfer using TLS 1.2+;
o 
regular backup testing will be performed to validate cross-zone recovery capabilities.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Measures in place to protect backup and restoration hardware and software, for example physical access
controls, surveillance systems, encryption, integrity checks and failover mechanisms.

them on different media.
• 
If applicable, settings of the cloud storage service ensuring it is configured to receive and store backup
copies.
4.3 CRISIS MANAGEMENT 
4.3.1. The relevant entities shall put in place a process for crisis management.
GUIDANCE
• 
Take into account industry-recognised standards when developing the crisis management process (38).
o 
Be aware that each crisis may be different and further analysis may be required on an ad hoc
basis.
o 
Consider the various aspects (e.g. technical, operational, communication and remediation) of
crisis management, including processes, roles and responsibilities.
(38) Additionally, consider:
• 
ISO 22361:2022, Security and resilience – Crisis management – Guidelines; 
•

60

--- PAGE 62 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
• 
Because the escalation of an incident to crisis status depends on an entity’s risk appetite and incident
handling capabilities, the entity should define criteria on when a crisis is declared (39). This may refer to
incidents that cause serious impact, beyond a certain threshold of tolerance. These criteria may include
the following (indicative and non-exhaustive list):
o 
the incident poses significant risk to critical assets or operations with high criticality, for example
high-severity incidents (e.g. data breaches involving sensitive information);
o 
the incident disrupts business operations significantly, for example prolonged downtime,
widespread loss of services or significant impact on customer service;
o 
the breadth of the incident, that is, whether it affects multiple systems, departments or geographic
locations, indicating a wider threat;
o 
the potential impact on the entity’s reputation – incidents that could lead to public scrutiny or loss
of customer trust should be escalated;
o 
the potential impact of the cybersecurity incident on the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and
availability of data;
o 
the sophistication and motivations of the threat actors involved. Incidents linked to advanced
persistent threats or organised cybercrime may require a higher-level response, beyond the
capabilities of the entity;
o 
the potential to escalate further (e.g. if vulnerabilities could be exploited again or if malware is
spreading).
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Crisis management process is in line with documented standards and/or good practices.
4.3.2. The relevant entities shall ensure that the crisis management process addresses at least the following elements:
(a) roles and responsibilities for personnel and, where appropriate, suppliers and service providers, specifying the
allocation of roles in crisis situations, including specific steps to follow;
(b) appropriate communication means between the relevant entities and relevant competent authorities;
(c) application of appropriate measures to ensure the maintenance of network and information system security in crisis
situations.
For the purpose of point (b), the flow of information between the relevant entities and relevant competent authorities
shall include both obligatory communications, such as incident reports and related timelines and non-obligatory
communications.
GUIDANCE
• 
For crisis communication, consider (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
legal obligations for communication, such as timing of communication, in particular referring to
requirements for notification;
o 
how information will be disseminated to internal and external stakeholders (employees,
customers, direct suppliers and service providers, emergency services, etc.) during a crisis;
o 
templates for communication;
o 
communication channels to be used for each type of stakeholder, considering that:
(39) According to ISO 22361, a crisis is an ‘abnormal or extraordinary event or situation which threatens an organisation or community and requires a 
strategic, adaptive and timely response in order to preserve its viability and integrity’.
61

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
• 
Awareness training regarding rules of engagement and behaviour should be delivered to the entity’s and
the suppliers or service providers’ personnel, where appropriate, based on the level of access to the
entity’s assets and information assets.
• 
Include relevant personnel of suppliers and service providers and their relevant responsibilities, in crisis
management tests, where appropriate.
• 
Make sure that contracts with suppliers and service providers are in line with the policy on the security of
network and information systems.
• 
When implementing a supply chain security policy, consider the following elements regarding the use of
free and open source software (FOSS) supply chain:
o 
When using FOSS without purchasing a related software product or entering into a service
agreement for development with the originator of the FOSS, obligations for compliance cannot
be imposed beyond the adherence to the terms of the open source software licence (45).
o 
Consider supporting the communities developing and maintaining FOSS and invest in a mutually
beneficial relationship with them. Where effective, this could involve relationships with the
relevant OSS steward that ‘provid[es] support on a sustained basis for the development and
ensures the viability of those products’ (46). Such a relationship should not qualify the steward as
a direct supplier or service provider, as imposing technical or methodological requirements might
not be appropriate, applicable or feasible considering their role.
o 
Consider steps to mitigate the identified risks to the security of network and information systems
as it relates to free and open source software dependencies:
 
before integrating free and open source components, require the direct supplier or
service provider to conduct a risk assessment and communicate the results to
understand potential vulnerabilities and their impact on the entity’s systems;
• 
where feasible, the risk assessment should be done in coordination with its
open source project or associated OSS Steward, at the expense of the supplier
or service provider using the component and in such a way that subsequent
risk assessments done by third parties benefit from this work;
 
require suppliers or service providers to provide evidence of their engagement with the
OSS community to ascertain whether adequate resources are available to support
sustainable maintenance efforts and contribute such resources where appropriate,
including to guarantee future availability of security patches;
 
ensure that free and open source components are regularly updated by the supplier or
the service provider to address all known and patched security vulnerabilities;
(45) OSS, also known as free software or FOSS, guarantees its users the essential four freedoms: use, study, share and improve. OSS can be used for 
any purpose and is free of restrictions such as licence expiry or geographic limitations. Its software code can be studied by anyone, without non‐
disclosure agreements or similar restrictions. It can be shared and copied at virtually no cost. It be modified by anyone, and these improvements 
can be shared publicly. The absence or weakening of at least one of these freedoms means an application is proprietary, so non‐OSS. The four 
freedoms are given by a software licence. Software licences define the conditions under which a programme can be used and reused. For it to be 
free software, the licence text must contain at least the four freedoms. The Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative maintain lists 
of reviewed and approved licences. An application can usually not be considered OSS if its licence does not appear in one of these lists.

 
require the supplier or service provider to perform regular code reviews and security
testing on free and open source components to identify and address any security
issues (47);
 
require the supplier or service provider to provide information on tools to manage
software dependencies (e.g. Dependabot, Yarn, Gradle and Pip) and ensure that all
components and their dependencies are secure and up to date;
 
require the supplier or service provider to provide clear documentation and policies for
using free and open source components, including guidelines for evaluation and
integration, along with evidence of efforts to ensure the sustainable maintenance of their
dependencies by nurturing the open source projects they rely on, such as by referencing
their public (code) contributions.
o 
Engage with relevant open source communities to stay informed about significant updates,
patches and best practices for using and updating their FOSS component.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Contract clauses that include, in addition to the elements referred to in point 5.1.4 of the Annex to the
regulation, one or more of the above lists with additional elements.
• 
Evidence of awareness trainings.
• 
Records from crisis management tests (Annex to the regulation, point 4.3.4), if available or written
confirmations by the supplier or provider after crisis management tests, which demonstrate the
participation of relevant personnel of suppliers and service providers.
• 
For FOSS (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
results from risk assessments of the FOSS,
o 
dependency monitoring tools,
o 
documentation.
5.2 DIRECTORY OF SUPPLIERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS 
The relevant entities shall maintain and keep up to date a registry of their direct suppliers and service providers,
including:
(a) contact points for each direct supplier and service provider;
(b) a list of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes provided by the direct supplier or service provider to the
relevant entities.
GUIDANCE
• 
Keep the registry up to date to ensure all information is current and accurate, that is, add, update and
remove suppliers and service provider from the registry in the event of changes.
(47) Suppliers do not necessarily need to perform security audits (and the resulting remediation efforts) themselves, but they can fund existing initiatives 
that perform open source security audits at scale (e.g. Sovereign Tech Agency, Alpha-Omega and the Open Source Technology Improvement 
Fund) or upstream (e.g. by funding a maintainer or by establishing contractual relationships with relevant Open Source Software Stewards to do 
that work). Additionally, suppliers and service providers should make any code reviews reusable for others to align with manufacturer obligations 
under Article 13(6) of the Cyber Resilience Act. 
  The term ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ denotes whether a component is being depended on (is upstream of) or is a dependent of (is downstream 
of) a component.

• 
Make sure that secure decommissioning service providers involve considerations such as deactivating
user and service accounts, terminating data flows and ensuring the secure disposal of the entity’s data
within supplier or service provider systems.
• 
Free and open-source software is often obtained free of charge from communities and projects developing,
maintaining and distributing software, as opposed to purchased from suppliers or service providers. When
using such software without purchase, relevant entities cannot impose obligations for compliance beyond
the adherence to the terms of the open source software license. Beyond that, it is good practice to apply
the guidance of section 6.1.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Evidence that internal (in-house) projects consider and prioritize security when acquiring ICT services,
systems or product processes.
• 
Evidence that points 5.1.6 and 5.1.7 of the Annex to the regulation are implemented.

EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Documented rules for the secure development of network and information systems which align with the
entity’s policies and norms and are based on relevant standards and good practices.
6.2.2. For the purpose of point 6.2.1., the relevant entities shall:
(a) carry out an analysis of security requirements at the specification and design phases of any development or
acquisition project undertaken by the relevant entities or on behalf of those entities;
(b) apply principles for engineering secure systems and secure coding principles to any information system development
activities such as promoting cybersecurity-by-design, zero-trust architectures;
(c) lay down security requirements regarding development environments;
(51) In addition, to those mentioned in the mapping table at the end of this section, consider the following:
• 
‘OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)’, https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/ , as 
updated from time to time. 
• 
ISO/IEC 27034 family, Information technology - Security techniques - Application security.

(d) establish and implement security testing processes in the development life cycle;
(e) appropriately select, protect and manage security test data;
(f) sanitise and anonymise testing data according to the risk assessment carried out pursuant to point 2.1.
GUIDANCE
• 
A secure software development life cycle (SSDLC) process should be implemented by all entities.
However, smaller entities can use a less demanding process such as implementing secure-by-design
practices and security-testing processes.
• 
Depending on the type of requirement, the rules for the secure development of software and systems
should include appropriate software testing methods (e.g. black-box, ad-hoc testing, static versus dynamic
application security testing).
• 
Test security by design at various stages of the secure development of the SSDLC prior to go-live, utilising
independent tools and a self-service testing platform throughout the SSDLC.
• 
When real production data - or derived variations of it - is used for testing, ensure that such data is properly
sanitised or anonymised. An indicative, non-exhaustive list of techniques:
o 
masking or pseudonymization on fields like names, emails, IDs;
o 
deletion or redaction of identifiers (e.g. personal IDs, birth dates, 
ZIP codes); and  
o 
non-irreversible or one-way anonymisation.
• 
When using Free and Open Source Software components, entities should take into account the voluntary
nature of open source projects (see guidance of section 5.1). Where possible, entities should assist the
open source projects that they depend on in adopting secure systems and secure coding principles (such

(c) security patches come from trusted sources and are checked for integrity;
(d) additional measures are implemented and residual risks are accepted in cases where a patch is not available or not
applied pursuant to point 6.6.2.
GUIDANCE
• 
Take into account well known standards when developing the security patch management procedures (58).
• 
Actions may vary, depending on the network and information system (e.g. mandatory patching for all exposed
systems or internet-connected devices such as firewalls or routers, and limited patching only in specific
circumstances, for instance in isolated or legacy systems where regular patching may not be feasible or
available).
• 
Establish a process, in combination with the asset inventory, for being informed when a new security patch is
published and schedule patch roll-outs accordingly.
• 
Patching should be a standard activity in normal maintenance and outage planning of services. Nonetheless,
some failures may require immediate patching depending on their criticality.
• 
Prioritise and apply patches based on risk. Evaluate the severity of the vulnerability, exposure of the affected
system and likelihood of exploitation.
• 
Deploy vulnerability management technologies to identify unpatched and misconfigured software.
• 
Define your relevant security information sources considering your assets and continuously monitor them for
patch announcements, patch and non-patch remediation, and general threats.
• 
Verify the patch sources through (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
digital certificates to verify the vendor;
o

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
o 
Blue/green allows the patches to be applied first in an isolated environment identical to the
production environment, and then in the production environment. This ensures zero downtime
and an immediate rollback option.
o 
Rolling (59) deployment allows gradual updates of parts of the production environment, one set
of servers or instances at a time, rather than deploying a patch all at once. It is ideal for large and
distributed environments.
o 
Feature toggles allow new features or patches to be deployed to production but keep them
disabled until they are ready to be used. They are suitable for control over new features or
patches when they are turned on, making it easy to test and release.
o 
Shadow deployment allows new code or patches to be deployed directly to production but it
shadows live traffic by mirroring user requests to both the current and new systems to observe
how the new version behaves without affecting the user experience. It is ideal for testing new
features in production without affecting users.
o 
Hotfix deployments are used for critical patches that need to be applied immediately to address
severe issues.
• 
Where appropriate and to reduce risks related to significant updates in important dependencies, consider
performing a trial using release candidates (60) of these components, to get an early indication of
incompatibilities or breaking changes, so they may be remedied. If any of these components are open
source software, offer feedback about any issues found during this trial.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE

(59) ‘Canary deployment’ is an example of this and refers to a gradual rollout strategy for software updates or patches. To minimise the risk of the patch 
introducing new problems, the entity might apply the patch to a small number (e.g. 5%) of servers or systems and then gradually apply it to the 
entire system. It is ideal for rolling out changes slowly and monitoring for problems without affecting many users. 
(60)  A release candidate is a ‘pre-publication’ or ‘trial publication’ of a software component, usually done in preparation before the publication of a 
software update with significant changes.

6.6.2. By way of derogation from point 6.6.1.(a), the relevant entities may choose not to apply security patches when
the disadvantages of applying the security patches outweigh the cybersecurity benefits. The relevant entities shall duly
document and substantiate the reasons for any such decision.
GUIDANCE
• 
Make an effort, proportionate to the entity’s size and importance, to ensure that security patches do not
introduce additional vulnerabilities or instabilities. Examples of information supporting such a decision may
include (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
vendor documentation on the patch:
 
what specific vulnerabilities or bugs are addressed,
 
whether the patch fixes a security issue, improves performance, adds features or
resolves stability concerns,
 
system requirements or any specific configurations required or changes to system
settings,
 
installation instructions on How to apply the patch and whether it requires a restart or
additional configuration;
o 
severity rating - patches that address critical vulnerabilities are more likely to apply; and
o 
security blogs, forums and mailing lists for any known issues or incompatibilities introduced by
the patch.
• 
If patching is not feasible, consider alternative measures such as strict configuration hardening, intrusion
detection systems, regular vulnerability scanning, network segmentation or isolation where feasible, access
control and monitoring.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Evidence of patch prioritisation for example emphasis is placed on patches assessed as critical.
• 
Evidence that residual risks resulting from non-patching are listed and mitigated.

- Device security supported by a policy which allows only known devices and EDR (6.9.2); 
- Network microsegmentation supported by logical segmentation (6.8), Next Generation Firewalls and a policy which prevents lateral movement; 
- Zero trust network access (ZTNA) supported by replacement of VPNs by ZTNA platforms, monitoring off all access requests and a policy which 
grants access to resources based on the combination of identity/device trust/context; 
- Application and data protection supported by cloud access security brokers (CASBs), data loss prevention (DLP) and encryption as well as 
monitoring of user activity; and

6.8.1. The relevant entities shall segment systems into networks or zones in accordance with the results of the risk
assessment referred to in point 2.1. They shall segment their systems and networks from third parties’ systems and
networks.
GUIDANCE
• 
Take into account well known standards when segmenting networks (66).
• 
Integrate the segmentation derived from the risk assessment into the network diagram.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
•

6.8.2. For that purpose, the relevant entities shall:
(a) consider the functional, logical and physical relationship, including location, between trustworthy systems and
services;
(b) grant access to a network or zone based on an assessment of its security requirements;
(c) keep systems that are critical to the relevant entities operation or to safety in secured zones;
(d) deploy a demilitarised zone within their communication networks to ensure secure communication originating from

(f) separate the dedicated network for administration of network and information systems from the relevant entities’
operational network;
(g) segregate network administration channels from other network traffic;
(h) separate the production systems for the relevant entities’ services from systems used in development and testing,
including backups.
GUIDANCE67, 68
• 
Make sure that the segments are in line with the results of the risk assessment (Annex to the regulation,
point 2.1).
• 
Apply a graduated set of measures in different logical network domains to further segregate the network
security environments, including:
o 
publicly accessible systems;
o 
internal networks;
o 
OOB connections; and
o 
assets with high criticality.
(66)  In addition to those mentioned in the mapping table at the end of this section, consider the following:
• 
NIST, ‘Guide to a Secure Enterprise Network Landscape’, NIST SP 800-215, https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/215/final. 
• 
ISO/IEC 27033 series of standards on network security. 
• 
NIST SP 800-215 and 1800-35 propose a zero-trust model, which assumes that no part of the network is trusted. 
(67) Different organisations use different terminology for the term ‘operational network’, for example ‘enterprise network’, ‘corporate network’, ‘IT 
network’, ‘OT network’ and ‘administration network’. However, the fundamental concept remains focused on the interconnectedness and 
functionality of components working together towards common objectives set by the management of the entity. 
(68) The network for administration of a network and information system, often referred to as network administration, involves managing, monitoring and 
maintaining an entity’s network infrastructure to ensure its optimal performance and security.

--- PAGE 100 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
• 
Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically and/or logically
separate from internal organisational networks.
• 
Determine the degree of physical separation of system components from physically distinct components:
o 
in separate racks in the same room,
o 
in separate rooms for the components with high criticality and
o 
more significant geographical separation of the components with high criticality.
• 
Implement separate network addresses (that is,, different subnets) to connect to systems in different
security domains.
• 
Monitor and control communications at the external boundary of the system as well as at key internal
boundaries within the system, including segmentation violations.
• 
Where appropriate, isolate information security tools, mechanisms and support components from other
internal information system components, where appropriate (69), by implementing physically separate
subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system.
• 
Route all networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed interface for the purposes of
access control and auditing.
• 
Implement a managed interface for each external telecommunication service.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Risk assessments that justify the segmentation decisions.
• 
Interviews with IT and security staff to understand the rationale behind network segmentation.
• 
Up-to-date network diagrams showing segmentation into different networks or zones (e.g. DMZ (70),
internal networks and guest networks).
• 
Verification that the diagrams align with business functions and risk profiles.
• 
Documented criteria for creating and maintaining different network zones.
• 
VLAN configurations on network switches and routers.
• 
VLANs corresponding to different security zones and business functions.
• 
Measures (e.g. IDS/IPS and monitoring systems) tailored to each network zone.
• 
Configurations of network devices (e.g. routers, switches and firewalls) for appropriate segmentation
settings.
• 
Configuration settings that match documented segmentation rules and diagrams.
• 
ACLs that consider segregation of duties.
• 
Firewall configurations.
(69) Technical method for segmentation should be considered, the usage of VLAN, physical separate switches or other methods should be defined. 
However physically separating subnets is not feasible in entirely software-defined environments (container clusters, cloud environments, etc.). 
(70)  A perimeter network, also known as a demilitarised zone (DMZ), is a subnetwork that separates an entity’s internal network from untrusted external 
networks, such as the internet. The primary purpose of a perimeter network is to add an extra layer of security by isolating external-facing services 
from the internal network.

7. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO 
ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CYBERSECURITY RISK-
MANAGEMENT MEASURES
7.1. For the purpose of Article 21(2), point (f) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the relevant entities shall establish, implement
and apply a policy and procedures to assess whether the cybersecurity risk-management measures taken by the
relevant entity are effectively implemented and maintained.
GUIDANCE
• 
Take into account industry-recognised standards when developing the policy and procedures for
assessing the efficient implementation of the measures (72).
• 
Implement a policy for assessing the effectiveness of implementation of measures that is proportionate to
the risk posture of the entity in line with the risk assessment.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Documented policy and procedures for effectiveness assessments based on good practices and
standards (73).
7.2. The policy and procedures referred to in point 7.1. shall take into account results of the risk assessment pursuant
to point 2.1. and past significant incidents. The relevant entities shall determine:
(a) what cybersecurity risk-management measures are to be monitored and measured, including processes and
controls;
(b) the methods for monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation, as applicable, to ensure valid results;
(c) when the monitoring and measuring is to be performed;
(d) who is responsible for monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the cybersecurity risk-management measures;
(e) when the results from monitoring and measurement are to be analysed and evaluated;
(f) who has to analyse and evaluate these results.
GUIDANCE
• 
When selecting measures for assessing effectiveness of implementation take into account the cost of their
implementation.
• 
Consider one or more of the following indicative methods for assessing the effectiveness of
implementation of a measure, according to the risk-treatment plan (section 2.1):
(72)  In addition to those mentioned in the mapping table at the end of this section, consider the following:
• 
ISO/IEC 27004:2016, Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management - Monitoring, measurement, analysis 
and evaluation.

Internal employees should be suitably trained, based on the skills required for the objective of
their role and the entity should consider their objectivity and impartiality, where possible. The
entity should pay particular attention to the elements of point 2.3. of the Annex to the regulation
concerning the impartiality of the employees. For instance, employees should not come from the
department or division whose systems are being inspected and should not have been involved
in developing the code or in installing or operating the system being audited for this purpose.
• 
Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of measures including, one or
more, notable examples such as (indicative, non-exhaustive list) (74):
o 
the cost of implementation and maintenance, for example capital expenditure (CAPEX) /
operational expenditure (OPEX);
o 
the number of employees who have attended cybersecurity trainings (75);
o 
the number of vulnerabilities detected;
o 
time to remediation;
o 
the number of incidents;
o 
the number of incidents related to a change;
o 
incident response times; and
o 
number of non-compliances (consider the elements in point 2.2 of the Annex to the regulation
concerning compliance monitoring).
• 
If possible, use the same KPIs for each assessment and utilize standardized templates and checklists to
ensure consistency and thoroughness.
• 
Although the frequency of monitoring and measurement of measures, addressed in point 7.2.1 (a) of the
Annex to the regulation, depends on the entity's risk assessment, the entity may follow this indicative, non-
exhaustive guideline:
o 
continuously monitor and measure the effectiveness of mitigating measures designed to address
real-time threats (e.g. firewalls, IDS/IPS);
o 
monitor and measure the effectiveness of security measures related to the threat landscape
biannually (e.g. vulnerability management and incident response plans);
o 
assess the overall effectiveness of all measures annually;
o 
assess the effectiveness of measures related to a specific incident following that incident; and
(74)  ENISA’s cybersecurity investment reports offer a good reference for measuring effectiveness of measures, for example the 2023 NIS investments 
report, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2023. 
(75)  The security culture framework (CSF) is an example source of KPIs for measuring the effectiveness of training.

ACCESS CONTROL
11.1 ACCESS CONTROL POLICY  
11.1.1. For the purpose of Article 21(2), point (i) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the relevant entities shall establish,
document and implement logical and physical access control policies for the access to their network and information
systems, based on business requirements as well as network and information system security requirements.
GUIDANCE
• 
Implement and maintain logical and physical access restrictions to network and information system 
based on access-control policies that take into account industry good practices. 
• 
Ensure that these policies are documented, communicated to all relevant stakeholders and include clear 
guidelines on the appropriate use of access privileges.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Access control policy document or documents outlining the access control requirements, procedures and
responsibilities.
11.1.2. The policies referred to in point 11.1.1. shall:
(a) address access by persons, including staff, visitors and external entities such as suppliers and service providers;
(b) address access by network and information system processes;
(c) ensure that access is only granted to users that have been adequately authenticated.
GUIDANCE
• 
Implement access control rules by defining and mapping appropriate access rights and restrictions to
human users or network and information system processes (e.g. a machine, device or a service). To
simplify access control management, assign specific roles to groups.
o 
Access control rules can be implemented in different granularities, ranging from covering whole
networks or systems to specific data fields and can also consider properties, such as user
location or the type of network connection that is used for access.
o 
Use business requirements and risk assessment results to define which access control rules are
applied and which granularity is required.
• 
Take into account the following when defining and implementing access control rules:
o 
consistency between access rights and asset classification;
o 
consistency between access rights and physical perimeter security needs and requirements;
o 
consideration of all types of available connections in distributed environments so entities are only
provided with access to associated assets, including networks and network services, that they
are authorized to use;
o 
consideration of how elements or factors relevant to dynamic access control can be reflected.
• 
Develop documented procedures and defined responsibilities to support the access control rules.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Access control policy document outlining the access control requirements, procedures and
responsibilities.

necessary.
• 
Reports from internal or external audits that assess the effectiveness of and compliance with the access
control policy.
TIPS
GUIDANCE
• 
Consider the two overarching principles most frequently used in the context of access control:
o 
need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information that it requires to perform its
tasks and in line with the asset classification levels of point 12.1 of the Annex to the regulation
(different tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and hence different access
profiles);
o 
need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information technology infrastructure where a
clear need is present.
• 
Consider the following when specifying access control rules:
o 
establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege (‘everything is generally forbidden
unless expressly permitted’) rather than the weaker rule (‘everything is generally permitted unless
expressly forbidden’);
131

--- PAGE 133 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
o 
changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the network and information
system and those initiated by a system administrator;
o 
when to define and regularly review the approval.
• 
Consider ways to implement access control, such as mandatory access control (MAC), discretionary
access control (DAC), role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC)
depending on the business needs of the organisation.
• 
Take into account the fact that access control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function
that evaluates past accesses or specific environmental values).
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Access control policy document outlining the access control requirements, procedures and
responsibilities.
• 
Access reviews showing adherence to need-to-know and need-to-use principles.
•

11.2 MANAGEMENT OF ACCESS RIGHTS  
11.2.1. The relevant entities shall provide, modify, remove and document access rights to network and information
systems in accordance with the access control policy referred to in point 11.1.
11.2.2. The relevant entities shall:
(a) assign and revoke access rights based on the principles of need-to-know, least privilege and separation of duties;
(b) ensure that access rights are modified accordingly upon termination or change of employment;
(c) ensure that access to network and information systems is authorised by the relevant persons;
(d) ensure that access rights appropriately address third-party access, such as visitors, suppliers and service providers,
in particular by limiting access rights in scope and in duration;
(e) maintain a register of access rights granted;
(f) apply logging to the management of access rights.
GUIDANCE
• 
Ensure each user only has access to information necessary for their role (‘need-to-know’).
• 
Restrict user permissions to the minimum necessary for their duties (‘least privilege’). Regularly review
and adjust access rights as needed.
• 
Determine which duties and areas of responsibility need to be segregated.  Establish and follow a process
for requesting and approving access, preferably automated. The process should:
o 
cover granting access rights to assets upon the new hire or role change of a user;
o 
obtain authorization from the owner of the asset, separate approval for access rights by
management bodies can also be appropriate;
o 
ensure that access rights are activated (e.g. by service providers) only after authorization
procedures are successfully completed;
o 
consider the business requirements and the entity’s access control policy;
o 
consider segregation of duties, including segregating the roles of approval and implementation
of the access rights and separation of conflicting roles;
132

--- PAGE 134 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
o 
verify that the level of access granted is in accordance with the access control policy and is
consistent with other information security requirements such as segregation of duties;
o 
consider giving temporary access rights for a time and revoking them at the expiry date, in
particular for temporary personnel or temporary access required by personnel.
• 
Establish and follow a process, preferably automated, for revoking access to assets. The process should:
o 
timely disable accounts upon the termination, rights revocation or role change of a user, as
needed; disabling accounts, instead of deleting accounts, may be necessary to preserve audit
trails;
o 
modify the access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs;
o 
remove or adjust access rights, which can be done by removing, revoking or replacing keys,
authentication information, identification cards or subscriptions.
o 
where feasible, enable different components or services to share information (signals) about
access revocation in a timely manner.
• 
Limit third-party access based on need and duration. Use temporary access accounts with expiry dates
and regularly review third-party access rights.
• 
Ensure third parties acknowledge their access responsibilities and obligations.
• 
Where appropriate (90), keep a detailed and up-to-date central record (register or database) of all granted
access rights, including user names, roles, permissions and dates of access changes.
• 
Establish and maintain an inventory of the authentication and authorization systems, including those
hosted on-site or with a remote service provider.
• 
Implement logging for all access rights management activities. Logs should include details of who granted
or modified access, when and what changes were made.
• 
Minimise the use of generic and shared accounts and ensure users can always be identified for their
actions within ICT systems.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Clear definitions of user roles and their corresponding access rights.
• 
A central record (register or database) detailing all granted access rights, including user names, roles,
access levels and dates of access changes.
• 
Approved access request forms supporting entries in the access rights register. Granting, withdrawals and
changes of access should be appropriately documented and visible in the register and consistent with the
process for granting and withdrawing access rights (Annex to the regulation, point 11.2.2). It is also
important that archived backups are properly secured to prevent unauthorised access. It should be
remembered that in the case of these copies, excessive permissions should be limited and controlled.
• 
Periodic access reviews meaning evidence of regular reviews of user access rights to ensure they remain
appropriate over time.
• 
System logs showing all access rights management activities (creation, modification and deletion).
• 
Audit trail logs demonstrating access rights management, including timestamps, user IDs and actions
performed.
•

access control policy referred to in point 11.1 of the Annex to the regulation (that is, only to individuals with
the necessary authority to carry out activities that require privileged access and based on the minimum
requirement for their functional roles).
• 
Identify users who need privileged access  (91) to a network and information system (e.g. operating
systems, database management systems and applications). This should include any privileged physical
access to, e.g. cryptographic codes, keys or devices and in line with point 13.3 of the Annex to the
regulation.
• 
Where appropriate, maintain an authorization process and a record of all allocated privileged access
rights, consistent with the process for granting and revoking access rights (Annex to the regulation,
point 11.2.2).
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Clear policy on privileged account usage and access rules for privileged accounts.
• 
List of users with privileged access and what systems they can access.
• 
Documented approval records for granting privileged access.
• 
Logs or records of access reviews and revocations.
• 
Role-based access matrix showing who needs what access.
11.3.2. The policies referred to in point 11.3.1. shall:
(a) establish strong identification, authentication such as multi-factor authentication and authorisation procedures for
privileged accounts and system administration accounts;
(b) set up specific accounts to be used for system administration operations exclusively, such as installation,
configuration, management or maintenance;
(c) individualise and restrict system administration privileges to the highest extent possible,
(d) provide that system administration accounts are only used to connect to system administration systems.
GUIDANCE
• 
Introduce higher authentication requirements for privileged access rights, such as re-authentication or
authentication step-up before using privileged access rights.
• 
Define and implement expiry requirements for privileged access rights, where appropriate.
• 
In the absence of a system that allows all uses to be attributed to an individual with certainty, establish
specific rules to avoid the use of generic administration user IDs (e.g. ‘root’) and manage and protect the
authentication information of such identities.
• 
Grant temporary privileged access only for the time necessary to implement approved changes or activities
(e.g. for maintenance activities), rather than permanently granting privileged access rights.

o 
Consider the frequency of system administration operations: daily tasks (e.g. backups and email
routing) versus weekly or monthly tasks (e.g. reviewing memory and disk space).
• 
Log all privileged access for audit purposes;
• 
Assign separate identities with privileged access rights to individual users, rather than sharing or linking
identities. Group identities for easier management if needed.
• 
Use identities with privileged access rights exclusively for administrative tasks, not for day-to-day general
tasks such as checking email or accessing the web. Where feasible (92), separate privileged identities
should be assigned for administrative tasks.
• 
Ensure users are aware of their privileged access rights or when they are in privileged access mode, for
example using specific user identities, user interface settings or equipment.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Measures for privileged access control and monitoring for privileged accounts, including granting and
revoking privileged access rights.
• 
Access assignment records showing how access rights are initially granted, based on job roles and
responsibilities.
• 
Clear definitions of user roles and the corresponding access rights associated with each role.
• 
Audit trail and monitoring logs that capture the use of access rights, including any unauthorized access
attempts and actions taken in response.
11.3.3. The relevant entities shall review access rights of privileged accounts and system administration accounts at
planned intervals and be modified based on organisational changes and shall document the results of the review,
including the necessary changes of access rights.
GUIDANCE
• 
Verify whether the duties, roles, responsibilities and competences of system administrators still qualify
them for working with privileged access rights.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Records of reviews and updates showing that access rights are reviewed regularly and updated as
necessary.
• 
Periodic access reviews meaning evidence of regular reviews of user access rights to ensure they remain
appropriate over time.
• 
Change management logs of changes to access rights, reflecting any alterations due to role changes or
termination of employment.
• 
Compliance audits with reports from internal or external audits verifying that the management of access
rights aligns with the policy and regulatory requirements.
(92) In environments such as Microsoft 365 where enforcing separate identities may conflict with Conditional Access, device compliance or session 
controls, privileged users may use a single identity provided that some additional compensating measures are in place e.g. MFA, just-in-time 
access, session logging, context-aware controls (e.g. location, device compliance, app enforcement) etc.

11.4 ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS  
11.4.1. The relevant entities shall restrict and control the use of system administration systems in accordance with the
access control policy referred to in point 11.1.
GUIDANCE
• 
Access to system administration systems must be strictly controlled in line with the access control policy.
Only authorized personnel should be granted such access and all activity must be logged and regularly
reviewed.
• 
Measures should be in place to detect unauthorized access and ensure accountability through audit trails
and periodic security assessments.
• 
Access logs from system administration systems should be integrated into the entity's centralized log
management or SIEM solution. Automated alerts must be configured to detect and notify of any suspicious
or unauthorized access attempts, ensuring a timely response and ongoing compliance with security
policies.
• 
The retention period for logs must be clearly defined based on business needs, legal requirements and
network and information security objectives.
• 
Logs should capture relevant events necessary for security monitoring, incident detection and forensic
analysis, such as access attempts, administrative actions and system changes.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Regularly maintained logs that track access to system administration systems (93).
• 
Audit reports from internal or external security audits that assess compliance with the policy.
11.4.2. For that purpose, the relevant entities shall:
(a) only use system administration systems for system administration purposes and not for any other operations;
(b) separate logically such systems from application software not used for system administrative purposes,
(c) protect access to system administration systems through authentication and encryption.
GUIDANCE
• 
Implement strict access controls to ensure that administrative systems are used exclusively for their
intended purpose. For instance, only allow authorised personnel with specific roles (e.g. system
administrators and IT staff) access to system administration systems.
• 
Physically or logically isolate administrative systems from other application servers, for example use
network segmentation to create separate zones for system administration systems and other systems,
such as application servers. If applicable, physically inspect server racks to ensure separation.
• 
Require strong authentication mechanisms such as MFA for accessing system administration systems.
• 
Encrypt communication channels (e.g. secure shell protocol, hypertext transfer protocol secure) to protect
data in transit to and from system administration systems.
• 
Encrypt sensitive configuration files and credentials stored on system administration systems.
(93) Administration systems refer to the tools and processes used to manage, monitor and maintain the hardware, software and network components of 
an entity’s IT infrastructure. Typical key functions of administration systems include (indicative, non-exhaustive list): system monitoring, 
configuration management, security management, user management and back-up and recovery.

11.5 IDENTIFICATION 
11.5.1. The relevant entities shall manage the full life cycle of identities of network and information systems and their
users.
GUIDANCE
• 
Establish and maintain an inventory of all identities managed in the entity.
o 
The inventory should include both user and privileged or system administrator identities. The
inventory should contain, as a minimum, the person’s name, username, start/stop dates and the
level of privileges for each identity.
o 
The inventory should also include all service identities and have these identity records as a
minimum including department owner, review date, purpose and the level of privileges for each
service identity.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
11.5.2. For that purpose, the relevant entities shall:
(a) set up unique identities for network and information systems and their users;
(b) link the identity of users to a single person;
(c) ensure oversight of identities of network and information systems;
(d) apply logging to the management of identities.
GUIDANCE
• 
Consider that providing or revoking access to assets is usually a multi-step procedure:
o 
confirming the business requirements for an identity to be established;
o 
verifying the identity of an entity before allocating them a logical identity;
o 
establishing an identity;
o 
configuring and activating the identity, which also includes configuration and initial setup of
related authentication services; and
o 
providing or revoking the identity’s specific access rights, based on appropriate authorization or
entitlement decisions (section 11.2).
• 
Make sure that identities assigned to network and information systems (non-human users) are subject to
appropriately segregated approval and independent ongoing oversight.
• 
Apply logging to the management of identities in cooperation with human resource security (section 10.1)
where possible.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Identity records, for example user profiles with unique identifiers (e.g. usernames and employee IDs) and
evidence of linking these identities to specific individuals (e.g. HR records).
• 
Logs of reviews or approvals for identities for network and information systems and their users.
• 
Logs or reports related to identity management.
• 
Evidence of the systems in place that enforce access control, such as IAM solutions.
11.5.3. The relevant entities shall only permit identities assigned to multiple persons, such as shared identities, where
they are necessary for business or operational reasons and are subject to an explicit approval process and
documentation. The relevant entities shall take identities assigned to multiple persons into account in the cybersecurity
risk management framework referred to in point 2.1.
GUIDANCE
• 
Shared identities should be avoided unless strictly necessary for business or operational reasons (94). In
such cases, their use must be formally justified, explicitly approved and properly documented. Examples
of technical, procedural and governance controls to enhance their protection include (indicative, non-
exhaustive list):
o 
MFA enforcement;
o 
Least privilege concept enforcement;
o 
Time-bound or just-in-time access;
(94) Wherever possible, the organization shall implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign privileges to individual identities based on 
defined business or operational functions. RBAC must be used to avoid the creation of shared accounts unless a technical or operational constraint 
makes their use unavoidable.
139

o 
Checking out the shared credentials through a tool which logs who accessed the identity and
when. If check-out is not possible, consider using privileged session recording or proxy-based
access auditing;
o 
Session attribution techniques to link shared identity use back to individual users;
o 
Logging;
o 
Credential vaulting with auto-rotation;
o 
Prohibition of storing shared credentials in personal files, emails or messaging platforms;
o 
Network segmentation so that shared account use is limited to isolated network segments or
virtual environments; and
o 
Mandatory training on acceptable use and accountability.
• 
These identities should be clearly recorded in the cybersecurity risk management framework, with
appropriate controls in place to mitigate associated risks, including enhanced monitoring and
accountability measures.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Approval records for exceptions.
11.5.4. The relevant entities shall regularly review the identities for network and information systems and their users
and, if no longer needed, deactivate them without delay.
GUIDANCE
• 
Verify that all active identities are reviewed. This can be done on a recurring schedule, as a minimum
quarterly, or more frequently. However, for micro-sized entities, this can be done annually.
• 
Disable or remove, in a timely fashion, identities that they are no longer required, for example delete or
disable any dormant identities after a predefined period of days of inactivity, where supported.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Records of reviews and updates showing that identities are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary.
• 
Records of changes to identities, reflecting any alterations due to role changes or termination of
employment or inactivity.
TIPS
GUIDANCE

11.6 AUTHENTICATION 
11.6.1. The relevant entities shall implement secure authentication procedures and technologies based on access
restrictions and the policy on access control.
GUIDANCE
• 
Authentication technologies are methods used to verify the identity of users, devices or systems before
granting access to resources. Here are some common authentication technologies (indicative, non-exhaustive
list):
o 
password-based authentication,
o 
passkeys,
o 
two-factor authentication,
o 
MFA (95),
o 
biometric authentication,
o 
token-based authentication, such as a one-time passcode (OTP),
o 
smart cards,
o 
Fast Identity Online 2 security keys,
o 
certificate-based authentication,
o 
SSO,
o 
OpenID Connect.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Access control policy documents outlining secure authentication procedures and technologies.
• 
Logs from authentication systems showing successful and failed authentication attempts, which
demonstrate secure implementation.
• 
Evidence of the systems in place that enforce access controls, such as IAM solutions.
• 
Internal or external audit reports verifying the implementation of secure authentication procedures aligned
with the access control policy.
• 
Documentation that shows the use of secure authentication and authorization protocols and demonstrates
that these have been tested to confirm that they are implemented in a secure fashion.
11.6.2. For that purpose, the relevant entities shall:
(a) ensure the strength of authentication is appropriate to the classification of the asset to be accessed;
(b) control the allocation to users and management of secret authentication information by a process that ensures the
confidentiality of the information, including advising personnel on appropriate handling of authentication information;
(c) require the change of authentication credentials initially, at predefined intervals and upon suspicion that the
credentials were compromised;
(d) require the reset of authentication credentials and the blocking of users after a predefined number of unsuccessful
log-in attempts;
(e) terminate inactive sessions after a predefined period of inactivity; and
(f) require separate credentials to access privileged access or administrative accounts.
(95) When implementing, the entity should take into account MFA fatigue, which can occur when users are overwhelmed when they receive numerous 
authentication prompts. Consider techniques to mitigate this, such as adaptive MFA, passkeys, MFA combined with SSO and short session 
timeouts.
141

--- PAGE 143 ---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
GUIDANCE
• 
Use unique authentication credentials for all the entity’s assets. Best-practice implementation includes, as
a minimum, an 8-character password for accounts using MFA and a 14-character password for accounts
not using MFA.
• 
Consider that the allocation and management process for authentication information should ensure that:
o 
passwords or PINs generated automatically during enrolment processes as temporary secret
authentication information are non-guessable and unique for each user; and that users are
required to change them after the first use;
o 
procedures are established to verify the identity of a user prior to providing new, replacement or
temporary authentication information;
o 
authentication information, including temporary authentication information, is transmitted to users
in a secure manner (e.g. via an authenticated and protected channel), and the use of unprotected
(clear text) electronic mail messages is avoided;
o 
users acknowledge receipt of authentication information;
o 
default authentication information as predefined or provided by suppliers is changed immediately
following installation of systems or software;
o 
records of significant events concerning allocation and management of authentication information
are kept and their confidentiality granted, and that the record keeping method is approved (e.g.
using an approved password vault tool).
• 
When passwords are used as authentication information, the password management system should:
o 
allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation procedure to
address input errors;
o 
enforce strong passwords (96);
o 
force users to change their passwords at first login, if relevant;
o 
enforce password changes as necessary, for example after a security incident or upon
termination or change of employment when a user has known passwords for identities that
remain active (e.g. shared identities);
o 
prevent the use of commonly used passwords, and compromised combinations of usernames
and password from hacked systems;
o 
not display passwords on the screen when they are being entered; and
o 
store and transmit passwords in protected form.
• 
The use of phishing-resistant MFA is recommended. Below is a list of currently available solutions ordered
from strongest to weakest.
o 
‘Strong’:
 
phishing-resistant:
- 
no shared secrets, not vulnerable to attacker-in-the-middle;
- 
protected cryptographic private key that can be securely registered to:
o 
a domain, in accordance with Fast Identity Online (FIDO) and W3C
WebAuthn standards;
(96) Password complexity can be a good cybersecurity practice, but it is not the only factor to consider. Recent guidelines, such as those from NIST, 
emphasise password length over complexity; see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63B-4.2pd.pdf, line 725.
142

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
o 
a trust provider, following public key infrastructure and International
Telecommunication Union X.509 standards.
o 
‘Medium’ MFA, for example:
 
push notification, number matching or application based.
o 
‘Last resort’ MFA, for example:
 
text message or email OTP.
• 
Perform password encryption and hashing in accordance with approved cryptographic techniques for
passwords (section 9.2).
• 
Generate an alert when a potential attempted or successful breach of login controls is detected.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Logs or reports related to authentication.

the policy and regulatory requirements.
• 
Documentation showing that the identities are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary.
• 
Records of changes to identities, reflecting any alterations due to role changes or termination of
employment.
11.6.3. The relevant entities shall to the extent feasible use state-of-the-art authentication methods, in accordance with
the associated assessed risk and the classification of the asset to be accessed and unique authentication information.
GUIDANCE
• 
Adjust authentication methods based on the associated assessed risk. For example, require additional
authentication for high-risk transactions or access to assets of higher criticality.
• 
Use more stringent authentication methods for assets of higher criticality.
• 
Ensure each user has unique credentials. Avoid shared accounts and implement strict policies for
credential management.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Access control policy documents outlining secure authentication procedures and technologies.
11.6.4. The relevant entities shall regularly review the authentication procedures and technologies at planned intervals.
GUIDANCE
• 
Conduct periodic audits of authentication procedures and technologies to ensure they remain up to date,
where appropriate and effective against emerging threats.
• 
Stay up to date on advancements in authentication technology and integrate new methods as they become
available.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Internal or external audit reports detailing the results of periodic audits of authentication procedures and
technologies.
• 
Logs showing the implementation of new authentication technologies and methods as they become
available
143

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
June 2025, version 1.0
TIPS
GUIDANCE
• 
Advise any user with access to or using authentication information to comply with the following.
o 
Secret authentication information, such as passwords, is kept confidential. Personal secret
authentication information is not to be shared with anyone. Secret authentication information used in
the context of identities linked to multiple users or linked to non-personal entities is solely shared with
authorised persons.
o 
Affected or compromised authentication information is changed immediately upon notification of or
any other indication of a compromise.
o 
When passwords are used as authentication information, strong passwords according to best
practice recommendations are selected. For example, passwords are not based on anything
somebody else can easily guess or obtain using person-related information (e.g. names, telephone
numbers and dates of birth); passwords are not based on dictionary words or combinations thereof;
use easy to remember passphrases and try to include alphanumerical and special characters;
passwords should have a minimum length.
o 
The same credentials are not used across different network and information systems.
o 
The obligation to follow these rules is also included in the terms and conditions of employment.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Documentation of training sessions for employees on secure authentication practices and technologies.
• 
Records of awareness programmes or communications to employees about the importance of secure
authentication.
11.7 MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION 
11.7.1. The relevant entities shall ensure that users are authenticated by multiple authentication factors or continuous
authentication mechanisms for accessing the entities’ network and information systems, where appropriate, in
accordance with the classification of the asset to be accessed.
GUIDANCE
• 
Select appropriate MFA (97)  methods and continuous authentication mechanisms based on the entity’s
security needs and depending on the classification of the asset. It is also good practice to consider user
convenience when selecting and implementing a solution:
o 
test-message-based OTP: simple but less secure due to risks such as SIM swapping;
o 
authenticator apps: generate time-based OTPs;
o 
push notifications: send an approval request to a user’s device;
o 
hardware tokens: for example physical devices generating OTPs, smart cards;
o 
passkeys;
o 
Fast Identity Online 2 security keys;
o 
biometrics: fingerprints, facial recognition, etc.
(97) Some types of MFA are vulnerable to phishing attacks, and the relevant entities should select MFA that can stand up to these attacks. For more 
information (indicative), see https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf and

asset to be accessed.
GUIDANCE
• 
Determine which network and information systems require the use of MFA protection based on the
classification of the asset to be accessed. Wherever possible, use phishing-resistant MFA.
• 
Analyse user roles and the level of access required by each role to determine appropriate MFA methods.
• 
Consider MFA, in particular when accessing systems from a remote location, accessing system administration
systems, access to sensitive information, etc.
• 
Enforce MFA on internet-facing systems, such as email, remote desktop and VPNs (99).
• 
Define when and how MFA is required (e.g. every login, once per session or for high-risk actions).
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Documentation detailing the classification of assets and the associated requirement for MFA protection.
• 
Risk assessment results justifying the need for MFA on certain network and information systems.
•

Implement secure fallback methods for users who lose access to their MFA methods.
• 
Educate users about the importance of MFA and how to use it.
• 
Regularly monitor MFA logs for suspicious activity.
• 
Keep the MFA system and associated devices updated.
(98) Unlike traditional authentication, which verifies users only at the time of login, continuous authentication dynamically assesses developing risk 
factors such as location, device status and behavioural patterns throughout the session. Different authentication methods (see section 11.6.1) can 
be combined during continuous authentication.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND 
PHYSICAL SECURITY
13.1 SUPPORTING UTILITIES 
13.1.1. For the purpose of Article 21(2)(c) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the relevant entities shall prevent loss, damage
or compromise of network and information systems or interruption to their operations due to the failure and disruption
of supporting utilities.
GUIDANCE
• 
Consider supporting utilities, where relevant (107), that ensure the continuous operation of network and
information systems, such as (indicative, non-exhaustive list):
o 
power supply – electricity to keep systems running;
o 
water for cooling and other operational needs;
o 
gas for heating or backup power generation;
o 
HVAC to maintain optimal operating conditions;
o 
telecommunications – internet and network connectivity.
• 
Include the potential failure and disruption of supporting utilities in the risk assessment.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
List of supporting utilities and associated risk assessment results.
• 
Measures to protect against the failure and disruption of supporting utilities.
13.1.2. For that purpose, the relevant entities shall, where appropriate:
(a) protect facilities from power failures and other disruptions caused by failures in supporting utilities such as electricity,
telecommunications, water supply, gas, sewage, ventilation and air conditioning;
(b) consider the use of redundancy in utilities services;
(c) protect utility services for electricity and telecommunications, which transport data or supply network and information
systems, against interception and damage;
(d) monitor the utility services referred to in point (c) and report to the competent internal or external personnel events
outside the minimum and maximum control thresholds referred to in point 13.2.2(b) affecting the utility services;
(e) conclude contracts for the emergency supply with corresponding services, such as for the fuel for emergency power
supply;
(f) ensure continuous effectiveness, monitor, maintain and test the supply of the network and information systems
necessary for the operation of the service offered, in particular the electricity, temperature and humidity control,
telecommunications and Internet connection.
(107) In cases where an entity operates with a fully remote workforce and does not maintain any on-premises servers or infrastructure, the requirement 
for supporting utility services at a centralized location may be rendered unnecessary. Remote work inherently introduces geographical and 
infrastructural diversification, thereby reducing the overall utility-related risk. By distributing operations across various locations, the organization 
benefits from a decentralized utility dependency, which enhances resilience against localized disruptions.

13.2  PROTECTION AGAINST PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS 
13.2.1. For the purpose of Article 21(2)(e) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the relevant entities shall prevent or reduce the
consequences of events originating from physical and environmental threats, such as natural disasters and other
intentional or unintentional threats, based on the results of the risk assessment carried out pursuant to point 2.1.
GUIDANCE
• 
Consider risks associated with current and forecasted physical and environmental threats to the network
and information systems, where relevant (108).
o 
Include in the assessment the (physical) locations of the entity’s facilities.
• 
Based on the results of the risk assessment determine the assets that need to be protected from physical
and environmental threats.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Risk assessment report that includes:
o 
identification and evaluation of physical locations, such as data centres, offices and server rooms,
o 
analysis of potential physical and environmental threats and
o 
mapping of critical assets to physical locations.
13.2.2. For that purpose, the relevant entities shall, where appropriate:
(a) design and implement protection measures against physical and environmental threats;
(b) determine minimum and maximum control thresholds for physical and environmental threats;
(c) monitor environmental parameters and report to the competent internal or external personnel events outside the
minimum and maximum control thresholds referred to in point (b).
GUIDANCE
• 
Implement measures against physical and environmental threats. Parameters to consider are (indicative,
non-exhaustive list):
o 
purpose and scope;
o 
network and information systems in scope;
o 
description of facilities;
o 
roles and responsibilities;
o 
management commitment;
o 
coordination among organisational units;
o 
compliance with national and EU law, including personal data protection.
(108) Where a company operates with a fully remote workforce and lacks centralized on-premises infrastructure, traditional physical and environmental 
threat protections at a single location may be less critical. The distributed nature of remote work inherently provides resilience by diversifying 
exposure to localized physical and environmental risks. Consequently organizations should focus on ensuring that remote employees’ home work 
environments meet minimum security and safety standards and consider leveraging cloud service providers’ robust physical security controls. This 
distributed operational model reduces dependency on any single physical site, thereby mitigating the impact of localized environmental or physical 
incidents.

13.3  PERIMETER AND PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL 
13.3.1. For the purpose of Article 21(2)(i) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the relevant entities shall prevent and monitor
unauthorised physical access, damage and interference to their network and information systems.
GUIDANCE
• 
Implement perimeter physical access control, where relevant (109), taking into account the measures for
protection against physical and environmental threats (section 13.2).
• 
Ensure that physical access control is integrated with logical and network access control, in line with
human resources security procedures (section 10.1) to support the detection of irregular activities and
enhance overall organisational security.
EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE
• 
Documented policy for physical security measures, including a description of facilities and network and
information systems in scope.
13.3.2. For that purpose, the relevant entities shall:
(a) on the basis of the risk assessment carried out pursuant to point 2.1, lay down and use security perimeters to protect
areas where network and information systems and other associated assets are located;
(b) protect the areas referred to in point (a) by appropriate entry controls and access points;
(c) design and implement physical security for offices, rooms and facilities,
(d) continuously monitor their premises for unauthorised physical access.
GUIDANCE
• 
In the risk assessment, consider risks associated with unauthorised physical access to, damage to and
interference with network and information systems.
(109) In a fully remote operating model where the organization does not maintain centralized office spaces or on-premises infrastructure, traditional 
perimeter and physical access control measures (e.g. badge systems, mantraps, on-site security personnel) may not be applicable. Instead, the 
focus should shift to ensuring that access to corporate resources is governed through strong logical access controls, such as multi-factor 
authentication (MFA), endpoint compliance checks and secure connectivity (e.g. VPN or Zero Trust Network Access). For personnel working from 
home organizations should provide guidance on securing home workspaces—such as restricting unauthorized physical access to work devices and 
using locked rooms or cabinets when necessary. Where third-party cloud or co-location facilities are used, physical access controls should be 
reviewed and enforced contractually through SLAs and verified via audit reports (e.g. ISO 27001, SOC 2).
