# Identity providers

{% hint style="success" %}
You can log into CISO Assistant with any identity provider (IdP), given that it supports either SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC).
{% endhint %}

Don't find documentation on how to set up SSO with your identity provider? Feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qvkaMdQ8da), or [contribute to the docs](https://github.com/intuitem/ciso-assistant-community/tree/docs).
